Rammed-earth is appearing today (at least in the U.S.) through academic programming (theoretical and in-situ), technological research (structural and thermal), and professional architectural design (modest and opulent). Consider the contexts around resurgences of rammed-earth in modernity:

\begin{flushright}
\small{
\textit{
``The current level of interest is actually the third wave of rammed earth popularity in the past two hundred years. The first wave reached its high point during the 1840s, and the second during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Both of the first two surges were stimulated by the quest for a low-cost, owner-capable method of construction; and both ended when mass-production and low-cost transportation made other, faster construction methods more accessible."}} \cite[p11, 12]{RAMMEDEARTHHOUSE}
\end{flushright}

From rammed-earth as a durable, agricultural building material fiting the nineteenth century rural economy; to rammed-earth as a practical form of housing fitting twentieth century economic miseries; to the twenty-first century seeing rammed-earth in light of ``sustainable development" applied to the perplexities of global energetics (a.k.a. energy economics), ecological economics, and the major role of physical building economies in these economic systems. Paradoxically, ``sustainability" did not appear in our vernacular until the 1960s. As such, contemporary building---itself built upon contemporary and mainly analytical science, technology, and building design---considers a seriously archaic, intuitive form of building motivated by global design constraints not totally formalized or observable until the mid-twentieth century. If truly paradoxical, does this phenomenon carry any epistemic or technical implications for the contemporary design of rammed-earth systems?

Particular geographic and cultural domains---for instance, Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa---share the veritably ancient heritage of earthen building, generally, and rammed-earth building, specifically. \cite{RAMMEDEARTHHOUSE} To contextualize this ancient form of building as fundamentally distant from contemporary building and design, Christopher Alexander discerns those building cultures wherein architectural, technological, and artistic forms are produced without reference to architecture, technology, or art as such:

\begin{flushright}
\small{
\textit{
``The cultures I choose to call ``unselfconscious" have, in the past, been called by many other names --- each name chosen to illuminate whatever aspect of the contrast between kinds of culture the writer was most anxious to bring out. Thus they have been called ``primitive," to distinguish them from those where kinship plays a less important part in social structure; ``folk," to set them apart from urban cultures; ``closed," to draw attention to the responsibility of the individual in today's more open situation; ``anonymous," to distinguish them from cultures in which a profession called ``architecture" exists.}} \cite[p33]{SYNOFFORM}
\end{flushright}

Alexander acknowledges the evolution of communication technology, conceptualizations (science of building), specialization, and growths in innovation and economy \cite[p33,34]{SYNOFFORM} as factors of the exponential increase in building's functional complexity (both in individual components and collective systems) over these thousands of years.

``Because the era before the eighteenth century is mistakenly supposed to have been technically backward, one of its best characteristics has been overlooked: namely, that it was still a mixed technology, a veritable polytechnics, for the characteristic tools, machine-tools, machines, utensils, and utilities it used did not derive solely from its own period and culture, but had been accumulating in great variety for tens of thousands of years. . . The introduction of new inventions like the clock did not necessitate on principle the discarding of any of these older achievements." \cite[p.134]{PENTAGON}}}

Into a later---more technically deliberate context---Pliny writes, about a century after Vitruvius' publication of \textit{De Architectura}:

\begin{flushright}
\small{
\textit{``Have we not in Africa and in Spain walls of earth, known as `formacean' walls? From the fact that they are moulded, rather than built, by enclosing earth within a frame of boards, constructed on either side. These walls will last for centuries, are proof against rain, wind, and fire, and are superior in solidity to any cement."}} \cite[p385]{NATHISTORY}
\end{flushright}

Into a moderninzing context, Thomas Jefferson writes to William Short concerning French architect Francois Cointeraux's advocacy for rammed-earth in the United States:

\begin{flushright}
\small{
\textit{``I had seen buildings in this way near Lyons, and moreover had known the author at Paris, where he raised some walls to shew his manner: and afterwards, while I was secretary of state, the President recieved from him lengthy details \& propositions on the same subject. How far it may offer benefit here superior to the methods of the country, founded in the actual circumstances of the country as to the combined costs of labour \& materials, and the circumstances of durability comfort \& appearance, must be the result of calculation."}} \footnote{“To Thomas Jefferson from Francois Cointeraux, 16 June 1789,” Founders Online, National Archives, last modified February 1, 2018, \url{http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-15-02-0192}.
