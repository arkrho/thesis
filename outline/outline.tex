--- architectural agenda for energy requires a more fluxable design program
--- flows of heat, information, energy, matter, people, all the same
--- flow design must have freedom to change, morph, evolve
--- a vertitable polytechnics evolved RE for thousands of years
--- time direction of change
--- centralized and distributed is one design
--- global and local is one design
--- intelligence is the ability to effect design change

P1: The Life, Disappearance, and Reappearance of RE
  1. Veritable Polytechnic
    a. Somatosensory Computation
    b. ``Overlay Method" of evolution
    c. Techniques for earthen arch. developed independently around the world
    d. built with maintenance in mind
  2. Modern Polytechnic
  3. Energy Crisis



P2: Contemporary RE Design
  1. Present in:
    a. research
      i. analysis -- seeks to define characteristic properties
      ii. new forms i.e. Forbes Garden
      iii. new methods --- i.e. sprayed earth
    b. professional architecture
      i. new forms i.e. Reformation slat
      ii. developing a taste for earthen architecture
  2. Addressing:
    a. building energy consumption
    b. transportation and assembly of materials



P3: Applications
--- querying soil database for emergetic analysis of collecting soil
--- FFT on local weather context
--- analysis of the soil triangle for heating/cooling
