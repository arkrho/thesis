\section{THERMODYNAMIC EARTH}

``The general struggle for existence of animate beings is therefore not a struggle for raw materials --- these, for organisms, are air, water, and soil, all abundantly available --- not for energy, which exists in plenty in any body in the form of heat albeit unfortunately not transformable, but a struggle for entropy, which becomes available through the transition of energy from the hot sun to the cold earth." --- Ludwig Boltzmann
